## React + Vite

This project uses Vite to power a fast React development environment with HMR and ESLint integration.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc)

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you're developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules. See [this template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for more info.
